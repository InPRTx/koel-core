> **Warning**
>
> This repository has been deprecated and archived. As web support constantly improves, the need for a standalone Electron app degrades. As a result, the [main repository](https://github.com/koel/koel) now contains code for both client and server components.



The core components and assets shared by the [web](https://github.com/koel/koel) and [desktop](https://github.com/koel/app) versions of Koel.
